# KoinX Crypto Tracker

This repository contains the codebase for the KoinX Crypto Tracker project.

## Purpose of the Master Branch

The **master** branch is maintained primarily to support deployment on the Render platform. It includes the stable and deployment-ready code that ensures smooth integration and hosting of the API server.

Any experimental or development work should be done on separate branches to keep the master branch clean and deployment-friendly.
